# ICE

ICE is a 3D general purpose game engine written in C++. The aim of the project is to have an engine good enough to create all kind of games in an easy manner, but not to compete with the big names (unity/unreal).

## Getting started

After cloning the repo with `git clone <url>` you can use CMake to build the engine. At the moment I've only tested the OSX building process.

## ECS Architecture

The engine is built with an Entity-Component-System architecture. This allow to have a vast array of behaviours on the different objects in the game very easily

## Roadmap

The [trello board](https://trello.com/b/Jstm3EL9/ice) of the project is available. This is a rough estimate of the progress done on the engine.
